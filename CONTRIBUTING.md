# Contributions

Any and all contributions are welcome! This is a decently sized project with a good scoped of functionality.

Organization is key for this project to have a logical order or projects, so before creating an application ask me to prepare the branch with the specific project so that you can work on it. Besides this project has a peculiar integration with Jest and EsLint and requires an additional manual configuration, feel free to contact me through a DM at @ruslanguns on Telegram or @ruslangonzalez on Twitter.

3. Create a new branch with the feature you are working on (e.g. feat/xxx) or with the issue number (e.g. issue/42)
4. Run `yarn`
5. Implement your changes, ensure tests are still passing, or add tests if it is a new feature
6. Push back to your version on GitHub
